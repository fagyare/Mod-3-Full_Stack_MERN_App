        Youth INC is a venture philanthropy organization whose mission is to transform the lives of NYC youth by empowering the nonprofits that serve them.
        We've taken a uniquely holistic approach to address the many different needs of nonprofits, from improving fundraising practices and building boards to funding critical infrastructure elements. By applying the best practices from the corporate, academic, and nonprofit sectors, we empower our partner nonprofits with the tools to achieve sustainable growth.
        Since our inception in 1994, Youth INC has raised over $110 million to strengthen more than 190 grassroots organizations that collectively have helped over 1 million young people achieve their full potential in life. Investments in youth-development organizations that build the Social Emotional Learning of young people produce an 11-point gain in grades and test scores and an 11x return for every $1 invested. This support means that Youth INC's more than $110 million raised has generated over $1 billion in impact.
        We envision a world in which all young people, regardless of their zip code, have equitable access to the opportunity to actualize their dreams and realize their potential.</h4>
